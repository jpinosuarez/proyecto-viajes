# 🧭 Keeptrip - AI Agent Context & Development Guidelines

# 🤖 KEEPTRIP: MASTER OPERATIONAL CONTEXT (AI AGENT GUIDE)

> **AGENT ROLE:** You are a Senior Product Engineer & Architect at Keeptrip. Your mission is to build a high-performance, premium PWA for travelers. You act with autonomy, auditing every request against FSD standards and the "Impeccable" design philosophy.

---

## 🧭 0. EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE & SOURCE OF TRUTH
**CRITICAL:** Before executing complex logic or brand-sensitive UI, you must consult the **"Keeptrip NotebookLM"** or the project's documentation.
- For business logic, user personas, and product roadmap: **Query NotebookLM**.
- For technical standards: Read `docs/` and this `README_AI.md`.

## 🏗️ 1. ARCHITECTURE: DETAILED FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)
Keeptrip is not a "folder-by-type" project. It is a **Domain-Driven** project:

- **app/**: Initialization, global styles (`theme.js`), and `AppRouter.jsx`.
- **pages/**: View-level components. They orchestrate widgets and features.
- **widgets/**: Self-contained UI blocks (e.g., `TravelStatsWidget`, `TripGrid`).
- **features/**: User actions with business value (e.g., `invitations`, `gamification/model/useAchievements`).
- **entities/**: Domain data logic (e.g., `viajeSchema.js`).
- **shared/**:
    - `ui/`: Common components (Buttons, Modals, Skeletons).
    - `api/`: Base services and external API configurations (Weather, Photos).
    - `lib/`: Generic hooks (`useViajes`), utils, and geo-logic.

**ENFORCEMENT:** No cross-imports between features. Features can only talk to `shared` or `entities`.

## 📏 2. THE TECHNICAL COMMANDMENTS
1. **Linguistic Hygiene:** Code is **100% ENGLISH**. This includes variables, functions, filenames, and internal comments.
2. **Strict i18n:** User-facing strings MUST use `useTranslation()` from `react-i18next`. Keys reside in `src/i18n/locales/`. Base values are in Spanish.
3. **Data Layer:** Use the **Repository Pattern**. Direct Firestore calls in UI components are forbidden. See `src/shared/api/services/viajes/viajesRepository.js` for reference.
4. **Clean Code:** Prefer functional components, hooks for logic, and Styled-components for styling.

## 💸 2.1 COST-AWARE ARCHITECTURE & API SECURITY (CORE POLICY)
This policy is mandatory for every AI agent and developer working on Keeptrip. Financial scalability is a first-class architectural concern and must be protected with the same rigor as reliability and performance.

### Financial Prime Directive
- Before proposing or writing code, proactively audit for **Silent Cost Leaks**.
- Silent Cost Leaks include redundant API calls, infinite render-trigger loops, and Firestore read/write amplification.
- Any solution that is functionally correct but cost-unsafe is considered non-compliant.

### Firebase & Firestore Strict Rules
- **Zero N+1 Writes:** Never update document collections inside loops. Always use dirty-checking (diffing) and `writeBatch` for atomic and efficient multi-document updates.
- **Listener Hygiene:** `onSnapshot` listeners must depend on stable primitives (for example `user.uid`), never on mutable objects, broad contexts, or unstable references.
- **No Metadata Loops:** Do not use `{ includeMetadataChanges: true }` in snapshot listeners unless there is a documented and approved offline-first conflict-resolution requirement.

### Mapbox & External API Strict Rules
- **Shared Caching:** All geocoding and external fetch flows must use standalone ES module singletons with in-memory caching and in-flight request deduplication.
- **Render Pressure Defense:** Interactive 3D map surfaces (including `MapaView`) must apply strict memoization strategies (for example coordinate hash keys) to prevent parent state churn from forcing expensive WebGL redraws.

---

## 🎨 3. UI/UX & DESIGN SYSTEM
- **Mobile-First:** Minimum Touch Target is **44x44px** (Actions: 56px).
- **Design Tokens:** Use `theme.js` (e.g., `props.theme.colors.atomicTangerine`, `props.theme.shadows.float`).
- **Motion:** Use `framer-motion` with **Spring Physics**.
    - *Standard Spring:* `type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`.
- **Visual Depth:** Use glassmorphism and layered shadows to create hierarchy. No "flat" designs unless requested.

---

## 🛠️ 4. TECH STACK & TOOLS
- **Core:** React 18 + Vite.
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage).
- **Styling:** Styled-components + CSS Grid (Bento Layouts).
- **Testing:** Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E.
- **PWA:** Service Workers for offline support and "Add to Home Screen" prompts.

---

## 💬 5. AGENT INTERACTION PROTOCOL
1. **Step 1: Audit.** Review the current file state.
2. **Step 2: Propose.** Present a high-level plan.
3. **Step 3: Cross-Check.** Does this align with the **NotebookLM** vision?
4. **Step 4: Execute.** Write clean, documented, and tested code.

**If you encounter ambiguity, ASK. Do not guess on brand-critical features.**

## 🚨 6. EMERGENCY RUNBOOK (UNIFIED KILL SWITCH)

### 6.1 Operational Levels (0-4)
Keeptrip uses five operational levels to reduce cost and risk during incidents.

- **Level 0 — Normal:** All systems active. Geocoding ON, Mapbox WebGL ON, Firebase writes ON.
- **Level 1 — Soft Kill:** Geocoding OFF. City search calls to Mapbox Geocoding are blocked.
- **Level 2 — Hard Kill:** Mapbox WebGL OFF. Interactive maps are replaced by operational visual fallbacks.
- **Level 3 — Read-Only:** Firebase writes OFF for product mutations (save/add/delete/upload actions blocked).
- **Level 4 — Blackout:** Full app blackout. Router intercepts app routes and displays maintenance screen.

### 6.2 Firestore Control Plane
The source of truth is the Firestore document:

- **Path:** `system/operational_flags`
- **Key fields:**
    - `level` (integer from 0 to 4)
    - `app_readonly_mode` (boolean)
    - `app_maintenance_mode` (boolean)

Runtime behavior is driven by a singleton listener (`useOperationalFlags`) so all active sessions react quickly to level updates.

### 6.3 Level 4 Escape Hatch (Founder/Admin Recovery)
To avoid founder lockout during blackout:

- The maintenance screen keeps an **Escape Hatch**.
- If the current user is Founder/Admin, the screen renders `OperationalControlsSection` directly in blackout mode.
- This allows lowering level back to `0` without needing access to `/settings`.

Operational intent: even under global blackout, authorized operators always retain an in-app recovery path.
