## 🤖 Part 1: AI Agent Autonomous Checklist

**AI MAGIC TRIGGER:**
> "AI: Run the `[Keeptrip Autonomous Pre-Flight]` trigger."

*Instructions for the AI Agent: When the Human invokes the trigger above, you must execute steps 1 through 9 sequentially. Do not ask for permissions between these automated steps. Upon completion, you MUST output the following exact markdown table format and nothing else as your final report snippet:*

```markdown
### 📊 AI Autonomous Audit Report (Part 1)

| Step | Task | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Static Analysis | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **2** | Unit Testing | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **3** | Security Rules | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **4** | E2E Verification | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **5** | Build Check | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **6** | Dependency Audit | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **7** | Environment Sync | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **8** | Deploy Staging | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | [Summary] |
| **9** | Performance (Lighthouse) | [✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED] | Perf: X, A11y: X, BP: X, SEO: X (TBT: X, LCP: X) |
```

These steps are to be executed by the AI Agent independently to ensure code integrity.

### 1. Static Analysis & Linting
- [ ] Run the linter: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **Target:** 0 errors. All warnings related to unused imports or variables must be resolved.
- [ ] Verify relative path imports are replaced by `@app`, `@shared`, etc.

### 2. Unit & Logic Testing
- [ ] Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] **Target:** 100% pass rate. Verify specific logic for authentication and trip management.

### 3. Security Audit (Firestore & Storage)
- [ ] Run security rules tests: `npm run test:rules`
- [ ] **Target:** Verify that `owner-protected` documents are strictly inaccessible to non-owners and that `invitees` have read-only access.

### 4. End-to-End (E2E) Verification
- [ ] Run Playwright tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] **Target:** Complete full user flows (Create Trip -> Add Stop -> Delete Stop -> Invite User).

### 5. Build & Architecture Verification
- [ ] Run production build: `npm run build`
- [ ] **Target:** Success with no Rollup/Vite errors.
- [ ] **Vite Chunk Verification:** Inspect the build output. Ensure `vendor-map` (Mapbox) is isolated into its own chunk and **not** bundled into the main `index.js` chunk. This is critical for TBT (Total Blocking Time) performance.

### 6. Dependency & Vulnerability Audit
- [ ] Run `npm audit`
- [ ] **Target:** 0 critical vulnerabilities.

### 7. Environment Variables Sync
- [ ] Validate `.env.production` and `.env.staging` structure.
- [ ] Ensure `VITE_USE_EMULATORS=false` for both environments.
- [ ] Verify `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` matches the intended destination.

### 8. Deployment to Staging
- [ ] Run: `npm run deploy:staging`
- [ ] Verify Hosting, Firestore rules, and Storage rules are deployed.

### 9. Automated Performance Audit (Lighthouse)
- [ ] **Tooling:** Run `npm run audit:performance`.
- [ ] **Data Extraction:** The exact scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) and metrics (TBT, LCP, CLS) will be logged to the console by the script. Use them to fill the metric summary in your final report table.
- [ ] **Zero-Footprint Policy:** The script is self-cleaning, but verify visually that you do not leave any `.lighthouse-tmp/` folders or `lighthouse-report.json` files behind.
- [ ] **Targets:**
    - Performance: > 85
    - Accessibility: > 90
    - Best Practices: > 85
    - SEO: > 85

## 👤 Part 2: Human-Mandatory Checklist

These steps require physical interaction and human judgment. **Do not skip.**

### 1. Real Device Mobile Smoke Test
**Requirement:** Use a physical mobile device (not a desktop emulator).
- [ ] **Navigation:** Verify that the bottom navigation bar is ergonomic and reachable.
- [ ] **Gestures:** Ensure smooth scrolling. **Zero horizontal scroll allowed.**
- [ ] **Touch Targets:** Verify all buttons (CTAs) are at least 44x44px and easy to tap.
- [ ] **Visual Polish:** Confirm Bento Grid alignment and Slate 50 (#F8FAFC) background consistency.

### 2. PWA & Offline Resilience Test
- [ ] **Airplane Mode:** Enable Airplane mode on your device while the app is active.
- [ ] **Verification:** Confirm the `OfflineBanner` renders immediately.
- [ ] **Stability:** Verify the app does not crash and allowed features remain interactive (Service Worker validation).

### 3. i18n Fallback & Leak Test
- [ ] **Visual Scan:** Quickly navigate through Dashboard, Editor, and Settings.
- [ ] **Verification:** Ensure no raw translation keys (e.g., `auth.title`, `trip.placeholder`) are visible in the UI. Everything must be rendered in the user's language.

### 4. Visual/Ergonomic Sandbox
- [ ] **Animations:** Verify `framer-motion` transitions are fluid (60fps).
- [ ] **Contrast:** Check that Atomic Tangerine (#FF6B35) CTAs have enough contrast against backgrounds.

### 5. Production Deployment (🛑 THE HARD STOP)
**SECURITY POLICY:** AI Agents are strictly forbidden from executing the final production deployment.
- [ ] **Action:** The Human developer must manually type and execute the following in their terminal:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:prod
  ```
- [ ] **Post-Deploy Smoke Test:** Verify `https://keeptrip.app` loads and user data is visible.
